### What

Minimalistic code snippet for parsing `mar` files.

Feel free to copy-paste in into your projects

### Why

Allow using file archives without adding dependencies.

My use case:

  - `bazel` build system makes it difficult passing non-constant number of arguments to targets
  - it is often desirable to pass corpus generated by fuzzer to quick-check or coverage
  - using `tar` or other advanced archives requires extra dependencies
  - `mar` is not something new; `pip install mar`
